  abstract =	"The class of visibly pushdown languages has been
		 recently defined as a subclass of context-free
		 languages with desirable closure properties and
		 tractable decision problems. We study visibly pushdown
		 games, which are games played on visibly pushdown
		 systems where the winning condition is given by a
		 visibly pushdown language. We establish that, unlike
		 pushdown games with pushdown winning conditions,
		 visibly pushdown games are decidable and are
		 2Exptime-complete. We also show that pushdown games
		 against Ltl specifications and Caret speci{\O}cations
		 are 3Exptime-complete. Finally, we establish the
		 topological complexity of visibly pushdown languages by
		 showing that they are a subclass of Boolean
		 combinations of Sigma_3 sets. This leads to an
		 alternative proof that visibly pushdown automata are
		 not determinizable and also shows that visibly pushdown
		 games are determined.",
